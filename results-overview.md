# Best model results

give auc. give other metrics. relat eback to reality of using in field. show improvemnt form previous models



talk about how we know we have reached the maximum extraction of information from our given dataset, it will likely only be improved with more data


## Temporal granularity

Model metrics have been computed based on file-level granularity. For scientist use in the filed, we are more concerned with day-level presence/absence monitoring. To determing the model's effectiveness at the day-level, we will review data from the 2024-2025 season to determine metrics for the ground-truth amound of true positive recordings collected.

it sould also be noted that the groud truth taken here, is still potentially different from the real ground truth of the amount of callig frogs, as we are working under the assumption that all calling frogs are picked up with our audiomoths.

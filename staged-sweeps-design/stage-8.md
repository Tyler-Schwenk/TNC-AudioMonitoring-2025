# Stage 8 - Appended label

Following up on a discussion from one of our meetings - this was another experimental sweep to gauge the effectiveness of monitoring for both RADR and Bullfrogs at the same time.

This could be beneficial when being deployed on a device with limited space for custom models, if we are also trying to monitor for a wider range of species within an environment.

This was just testing the version that appends labeles - so searched for both bullfrogs and RADR. \
this was tested to get an idea of how effective monitoring for both species at the same time could be. GIVE COMPARATIVE DATA HERE FROM SIMILAR RUNS.\
this is also outsde the scope of the contract, as they call at separate times

#### Stage 8 – OOD Performance Summary

| Experiments                           | OOD F1 (mean ± std) | OOD Precision (mean ± std) | OOD Recall (mean ± std) |

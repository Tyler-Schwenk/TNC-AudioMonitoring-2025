# Stage 9

This was where i ttempted using my custom validation set instead of the birdnet default pulling 20 from my standard set.

this gave worse resultds (despite having more total data), likely due to the fact that the majority ofthe data was less than high quality (find these numbers). \
in the future i think i will just put all data into training then have the birdnet pull the subset itsel. maybe even could run a sweep on these

# Stage 10

this one i just confirmed how the same setup as my winning stage 6 would perform now that i pulled out the fault data as previously described:\
on 11/30/2025 i found that some positive audio files snuck into these folders. they seemed to be from recorder 12. for that reason i removed all recorder 12 audio files from these. to be clear - the stages (6-8) that were trained before now did include these positives in these folders. but there weren't a lot. so im just going to remove them and move forward with other runs. saving them here in case i want to review later or something

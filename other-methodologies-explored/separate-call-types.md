# Separate Call Types

## Focus on specific call type

the California red-legged frog has two distinct call types, one of shorter repeating 'grunts', and another, less common call type of a longer, lower 'growl' (often preceded by grunts).

In this experimental stage, I briefly explored the idea of training the model to identify specific types of the California red-legged frog's call, rather than both as the same label.

This would take a significant amount of time to make a new experiment structure and testing dataset around each call type, and I consider it out of the scope of this current contract. It is an idea that could be explored in the future though
